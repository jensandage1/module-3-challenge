## Usage

This webpage has a headline in the middle that is clearly labeled "password generator". There is a box that is labeled "generate a password" with a blank box underneath it and a "generate password" button. When the button is clicked a series of prompts will let the user decide how long their password will be, and whether it included uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters. Once the prompts are all answered a randomized password based on their choices will display in the empty box above the button.
